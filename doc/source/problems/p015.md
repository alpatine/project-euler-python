# Project Euler 15 - Lattice Paths

## Problem Description
The problem reads:

> Starting in the top left corner of a $2 \times 2$ grid, and only being able to
> move to the right and down, there are exactly $6$ routes to the bottom right
> corner.

>
> How many such routes are there through a $20 \times 20$ grid?

## Analysis of Given Example
We start by analysing the given example. In the following table, each possible
path is represented in two ways. The first column is a string of steps where
right steps are written as $R$ and a down steps are written as $D$. The second
column shows which positions in the path are right steps.

$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Path} & \text{String} & \text{Right step positions} \\
\hline
1 & RRDD & (1, 2) \\
2 & RDRD & (1, 3) \\
3 & RDDR & (1, 4) \\
4 & DRRD & (2, 3) \\
5 & DRDR & (2, 4) \\
6 & DDRR & (3, 4) \\
\hline
\end{array}$$

Notice that each path is $4$ steps long and contains exactly $2$ right steps and
$2$ down steps. Every possible way to choose $2$ distinct positions out of the
available $4$ to be a right step is present in the table. The order of choosing
the positions doesn't matter. For example, choosing position $1$ then position
$2$ gives the same result as choosing position $2$ then position $1$, they both
result in having a right step in positions $1$ and $2$.

Choosing a number of objects from a larger set where the ordering of the chosen
objects doesn't matter and there is no repetition is known as a combination.
Combinations have their own notation and a well known formula.

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Number of positions available to choose from} &= n \\
\text{Number of chosen positions} &= k \\
\text{Number of ways to choose} &= \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\end{aligned}$$

Applying this to the given example, where we need to choose $2$ positions in a
$4$ position path to be right steps:

$$\begin{aligned}
\binom{4}{2} &= \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} \\
&= \frac{4!}{2!2!} \\
&= \frac{\cancel4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2}{\cancel 2 \cdot \cancel 2} \\
&= 6
\end{aligned}$$

## Solution
The problem asks for the number of paths through a $20 \times 20$ grid. In that
grid, each path will need to have $20$ right steps and $20$ down steps. To
calculate this we must find the number of ways to choose $20$ positions out of
the $40$ available to be right steps.

$$\begin{aligned}
\binom{40}{20} &= \frac{40!}{20!(40-20)!} \\
&= \frac{40!}{20!20!} \\
&= \frac{40 \cdots 21}{20 \cdots 1}
   \cdot \cancel{\frac{20 \cdots 1}{20 \cdots 1}}\\
&= \frac{335367096786357081410764800000}{2432902008176640000} \\
&= 137846528820
\end{aligned}$$

## Python Implementation
``` python
from math import comb

def p15(grid_size: int) -> int:
    return comb(2 * grid_size, grid_size)

print(p15(40, 20))
```
