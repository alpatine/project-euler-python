## Least Common Multiple
The smallest number $l$ that is divisible by two numbers $a$, $b$, is referred
to as the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$, and is written as:
$\newcommand{\lcm}{\textrm{lcm}}$

$$ l = \lcm(a,b) $$

There are several ways to calculate the least common multiple. The approach we
will explore is factorising each number into primes, then multiply the largest
power of each prime factor between $a$ and $b$ into $l$.

Example: Find the $\lcm$ of 90 and 420.

$$\begin{aligned}
    90 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 &= 2^1 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^0 \\
    420 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 &= 2^2 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^1
\end{aligned}$$

Visual inspection of the prime factorisation shows that the greatest power of 2
is $2^2$, 3 is $3^2$, 5 is $5^1$, and 7 is $7^1$. Multiplying these powers
together gives the least common multiple:

$$ \lcm(90, 420) = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^1 = 1260$$

The least common multiple function can be extended to accecpt multiple numbers.
To do this we factorise all of the numbers involved, and keep the highest prime
powers just as we did for two numbers.

Example: Find the $\lcm$ of 10, 15, and 20.

$$\begin{aligned}
    10 = 2 \cdot 5 &= 2^1 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^1 \\
    15 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 &= 2^1 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1 \\
    20 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5 &= 2^2 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^1
\end{aligned}$$

Again, we take the highest power of each prime and multiply them together to get
the lcm:

$$\lcm(10, 15, 20) = 2^2 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1 = 60$$

The problem can now be stated as finding $\lcm(1, 2, 3, \dots, 20)$.

We can ignore the number 1 because adding it to the product will have no impact.
So, we start by factoring the numbers from 2 to 20.

$$\begin{aligned}
    2 = 2 &= 2^1 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^0 \cdot 11^0 \cdot 13^0 \cdot 17^0
        \cdot 19^0 \\
    3 = 3 &= 2^0 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^0 \cdot 11^0 \cdot 13^0 \cdot 17^0
        \cdot 19^0 \\
    4 = 2 \cdot 2 &= 2^2 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^0 \cdot 11^0 \cdot 13^0
        \cdot 17^0 \cdot 19^0 \\
    5 = 5 &= 2^0 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^0 \cdot 11^0 \cdot 13^0 \cdot 17^0
        \cdot 19^0 \\
    6 = 2 \cdot 3 &= 2^1 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^0 \cdot 11^0 \cdot 13^0
        \cdot 17^0 \cdot 19^0 \\
    7 = 7 &= 2^0 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^1 \cdot 11^0 \cdot 13^0 \cdot 17^0
        \cdot 19^0 \\
    8 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 &= 2^3 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^0 \cdot 11^0
        \cdot 13^0 \cdot 17^0 \cdot 19^0 \\
    9 = 3 \cdot 3 &= 2^0 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^0 \cdot 11^0 \cdot 13^0
        \cdot 17^0 \cdot 19^0 \\
    10 = 2 \cdot 5 &= 2^1 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^0 \cdot 11^0 \cdot 13^0
        \cdot 17^0 \cdot 19^0 \\
    11 = 11 &= 2^0 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^0 \cdot 11^1 \cdot 13^0
        \cdot 17^0 \cdot 19^0 \\
    12 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 &= 2^2 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^0 \cdot 11^0
        \cdot 13^0 \cdot 17^0 \cdot 19^0 \\
    13 = 13 &= 2^0 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^0 \cdot 11^0 \cdot 13^1
        \cdot 17^0 \cdot 19^0 \\
    14 = 2 \cdot 7 &= 2^1 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^1 \cdot 11^0 \cdot 13^0
        \cdot 17^0 \cdot 19^0 \\
    15 = 3 \cdot 5 &= 2^0 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^0 \cdot 11^0 \cdot 13^0
        \cdot 17^0 \cdot 19^0 \\
    16 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 &= 2^4 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^0
        \cdot 11^0 \cdot 13^0 \cdot 17^0 \cdot 19^0 \\
    17 = 17 &= 2^0 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^0 \cdot 11^0 \cdot 13^0
        \cdot 17^1 \cdot 19^0 \\
    18 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 &= 2^1 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^0 \cdot 11^0
        \cdot 13^0 \cdot 17^0 \cdot 19^0 \\
    19 = 19 &= 2^0 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^0 \cdot 11^0 \cdot 13^0
        \cdot 17^0 \cdot 19^1 \\
    20 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5 &= 2^2 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^0 \cdot 11^0
        \cdot 13^0 \cdot 17^0 \cdot 19^0
\end{aligned}$$

Looking down the list we see that the answer is:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \lcm(1, 2, 3, \dots, 20) &= 2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^1 \cdot 11^1
        \cdot 13^1 \cdot 17^1 \cdot 19^1 \\
    &= 16 \cdot 9 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \cdot 17 \cdot 19 \\
    &= 232792560
\end{aligned}  $$

## Using Logarithms
Looking at the lcm calculation above, there was a lot of work put into factoring
the 20 numbers. Here we will explore an alternative approach that can be used
when looking for the lcm of consecutive numbers from 1 to $n$.

Consider the highest power of 2 that was included: $2^4 = 16$. That is the
largest power of 2 less than 20 because $2^5 = 32 > 20$. Now consider the
highest power of 3 that was included: $3^2 = 9$. That is the largest power of 3
less than 20 because $3^3 = 27 > 20$. This pattern continues for all of the
primes below 20.

This approach directly accounts for the lcm of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9,
11, 13, 16, 17, and 19 because they are all powers of a single prime less than
the max power of that prime less than 20. What about the remaining numbers 6,
10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20?

It turns out that all of those missing numbers are each a multiple of a
combination of the already accounted for numbers. We have already shown there
can be no higher power of any individual prime, the divisors of a missing number
must be less than the missing number, and every number has a unique prime
factorisation. These three facts together mean that all of the missing numbers
were actually accounted for as well.

Taking 20, the last missing number, as an example. It's prime factorisation is
$2^2 \cdot 5^1$. When we evaluate the powers of the primes this becomes $4 \cdot
5$, both of which are on the already accounted for list.

So how do we quickly determine the highest power of a prime less than $n$? We
use logarithms.

Exploring with the prime 2, we would expect the highest power to be 4, giving us
the number 16 to include in the final product:

$$\begin{aligned}
    20 &= 20 \\
    \log_2{20} &= 4.321928095\dots && \text{(take base 2 log)}\\
    \lfloor\log_2{20}\rfloor &= 4 && \text{(take floor of both sides)} \\
    2^{\lfloor\log_2{20}\rfloor} &= 16
        && \text{(exponentiate both sides with base 2)}
\end{aligned}$$

This approach works for each prime, so in general for an lcm from 1 to $n$, we
have:

$$\lcm(1, 2, 3, \dots, n) =
    \prod_{\substack{p \leq n\\p\text{-prime}}}{p^{\lfloor \log_p{n} \rfloor}}$$

In the case of $\lcm(1, 2, 3, \dots, 20)$ we have:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \lcm(1, 2, 3, \dots, 20) ={}& \prod_{\substack{p \leq 20\\p\text{-prime}}}
        {p^{\lfloor \log_p{20} \rfloor}} \\
    ={}& 2^{\lfloor \log_2{20} \rfloor}
        \cdot 3^{\lfloor \log_3{20} \rfloor}
        \cdot 5^{\lfloor \log_5{20} \rfloor}
        \cdot 7^{\lfloor \log_7{20} \rfloor}
        \cdot 11^{\lfloor \log_{11}{20} \rfloor} \\
    {}& \cdot 13^{\lfloor \log_{13}{20} \rfloor}
        \cdot 17^{\lfloor \log_{17}{20} \rfloor}
        \cdot 19^{\lfloor \log_{19}{20} \rfloor} \\
    ={}& 2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^1 \cdot 11^1 \cdot 13^1 \cdot 17^1
        \cdot 19^1 \\
    ={}& 232792560
\end{aligned}$$

## Python Implementation
``` python
from math import floor, log, prod

primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
print(prod(prime ** floor(log(20, prime)) for prime in primes))
```
