# Project Euler 10 - Summation of Primes

## Problem Description
The problem reads:

> The sum of the primes below $10$ is $2+3+5+7=17$.
>
> Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

## Solution
To solve this problem, we will use the prime number generator described in
{doc}`/prelim/generating-prime-numbers`. The prime generator takes an argument
representing the number to search up to while looking for primes. The last step
is to sum the output from the generator, giving the result $142913828922$.

``` python
return sum(primes(2000000))
```
