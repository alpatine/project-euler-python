# Project Euler 17 - Number Letter Counts

## Problem Description
The problem reads:

> If the numbers $1$ to $5$ are written out in words: one, two, three, four,
> five, then there are $3+3+5+4+4=19$  letters used in total.
> 
> If all the numbers from $1$ to $1000$ (one thousand) inclusive were written
> out in words, how many letters would be used?
> 
> **NOTE**: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, $342$ (three hundred
> and forty-two) contains $23$ letters and $115$ (one hundred and fifteen)
> contains $20$ letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in
> compliance with British usage.

## Approach
We will use a {doc}`function that converts numbers into words
</prelim/numbers-to-words>` to generate the letters. From there, we simply need
count the letters for each number, keeping a running total as we consider the
numbers from $1$ to $1000$.

## Python Implementation
``` python
def p17(stop: int) -> int:
    return sum([len(number_to_words(n)) for n in range (1, stop)])

p17(1001)
```
